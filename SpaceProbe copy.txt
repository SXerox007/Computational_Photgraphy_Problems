Here's the solution of Space Probe

Probe take 200 reading per day.
Temp. varies: -100 to +150.
Only send 100 bytes per day.

Terms that are used:
1 byte = 8 bit
and bit only store 0 and 1
integer takes :- 4 byte
character takes:- 2 byte


Problem solution:-
Let's start we know we have 100 bytes
so, we can sent earth to 100/4 = 25 readings.
we have 24 hr in a day.
So, it simplyfy the problem.
Every hour one temp. we store into 4 byte.
so, we consume 24*4
i.e 96 hr.
we left over with 4 bytes.
Use case of 4 byte:-
To meke it simple we know we have 4 bytes left over
When we sent data to earth we add 2-2 byte of character
i.e
for Max temp:- we add in starting "Mx" in 2 bytes of that temprature.
for Min temp:- we add in starting "Mn" in 2 bytes of that temprature.
Here we can find the approx max and min temprature.




Requirement 1:-
We need to know the temp on particular time.
We send all the hr data. So,
Suppose if the scientist want the temp on 8PM we have temp on that time. If he want data 8AM we also have data on that time.
We data in continuty along with Mi and Mx.
We send every 4 byte 1hr temp.
24*4 = 96 byte it consume.


Requirement 2:-
We need to find the approx minimum and Maximum temp.
We have left 4 byte of data when we send the data we add Mi and Mx to maximum and minimum of the temp.
Here We consume all 100 byte.
